Python module to Parse through emails and grab relevant information and write to a CSV file.


Description
===========

Why?:
We needed a module that would parse through emails, and pull WiFi sign up details and export them to a CSV for future reference.
The module can grab emails, read them, archive them and write the relevant information to a CSV file.

This uses the following modules:
argparse, csv, logging, os, sys, win32com.client, win32com

You can install the requirements by running the following in the working directory:
pip install -r requirements.txt
