__initial_setup__

    You will want to open main.py
    Change line 17 to the email address being used on the machine

    You will want to create a folder on the outlook inbox
    You can call it anything you want but line 22 must change to match
    I used 'Archived Wifi'

    To run the program, you will need to install python and then run 'python main.py' whilst in the working directory
    
    Please note: 
    Everything in python is Caps Sensitive.
    Code may need changing depending if the Wifi form changes
